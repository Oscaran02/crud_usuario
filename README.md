## Development

I decided to use pipenv because I find the installation of dependencies and its 
app setup very easy and convenient.

### Setup

1. Install pipenv
    ```shell
    pip install pipenv
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```shell
    cd <project_dir>
    pipenv install --three
    ```

### Run it

If you are not already in the `app` directory:

```shell
cd <project_dir>
```

```shell
pipenv run python app.py
```
